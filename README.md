# Guess-the-Number
Guess the Number Game In this game, your goal is to guess a random number between 1 and 10. You start with a score of 10, and for each wrong guess, your score decreases by 1. The game gives you feedback after each guess, letting you know if your guess was too low or too high compared to the randomly chosen number.
